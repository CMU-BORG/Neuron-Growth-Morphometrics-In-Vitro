# R code for performing the "circular change point test" (CPT)

# Detecting changes of direction in terrestrial ranging."
# by R W Byrne, R G Noser, L A Bates & P E Jupp. 
# Animal Behaviour 77, 619-631, 2009.

#####
# The CPT Rcode from Byrne et al. (2009) was modified for 
# A S Liao, W Cui, V Webster-Wood, Y J Zhang
# Semi-automated quantitative evaluation of neuron developmental morphology in vitro using the change-point test
# Submitted to: Neuroinformatics 2022
#
# This is an "automated" version in which 
# (a) q  and  alpha  are set by the user;
#       (i)  alpha = significance level; alpha = 0.05 is a convenient default
#       (ii) The user should replace this by a value of q that is appropriate for the species and data 
#            considered, e.g. that obtained by running CPT_Rcode on part of the data. 
# (b) the parameters N (number of permutations) and
# tol (maximum distance between indistinguishable 
# positions) may be changed by the user manually in the code itself; 

# INPUTS
#     (i)   filetot - the filename of the file with the data (coordinates) - includes full file path
#     (ii)  fileext - the file extension of the data file (typically "txt")
#     (iii) q - q parameter (refer to Byrne et al (2009))
#     (iv)  alpha - significance level (refer to Byrne et al (2009))

# OUTPUTS:
#     (i) (to Environment) a list (in cps) of (row numbers and 
#         coordinates of) waypoints that are detected as  significant
#     (ii) (to directory) a plot of the path on which change points are indicated.
